    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p id="date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 26, 2025</p>
    <p>ASK Productions built the <strong>Auorta Learning</strong> app as a free educational platform for competitive exam aspirants. This SERVICE is provided at no cost and is intended for use as-is.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The app collects limited personal information such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User name and chosen exam (for profile personalization)</li>
      <li>Profile image (stored locally only)</li>
      <li>Email address (provided during profile setup)</li>
      <li>Phone number (optional, if the user provides it for support or communication)</li>
      <li>Study progress, syllabus completion, and mock test results (stored offline in the app's database)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No sensitive personal data such as precise location is collected.</p>

    <h2>File Uploads</h2>
    <p>Users can voluntarily upload educational files (such as PDFs, notes, or other study materials) through the app. During this upload process, the following information is securely transmitted to our Telegram bot:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The uploaded file</li>
      <li>User's name</li>
      <li>User's email address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These details are used solely for the purpose of reviewing and verifying the uploaded content before publishing it within the app.</p>
    <p>If any uploaded material is found to violate our content policies or legal guidelines, we will delete the file from our systems immediately upon discovery. However, since the upload occurs via Telegram, files may also be stored on Telegram's servers according to their own data policies. Additionally, if any uploaded file is forwarded or shared by other users within Telegram, we are not responsible for the distribution, use, or storage of such files outside of our control.</p>
    <p>By using the file upload feature, users acknowledge and accept these conditions.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Firebase Analytics and Messaging</li>
      <li>MPAndroidChart (for data visualization)</li>
      <li>Retrofit and OkHttp (for network requests)</li>
      <li>Telegram Bots (for file uploads)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><code>INTERNET</code> – For loading content and communicating with servers</li>
      <li><code>POST_NOTIFICATIONS</code> – To notify users about study sessions (Future Updates)</li>
      <li><code>SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM</code> – For accurate study session alerts (Future Updates)</li>

      <li><code>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</code> – To check network status</li>
      <li><code>FOREGROUND_SERVICE</code> – To show timely notifications</li>
      <li><code>AD_ID</code> – Used if ads are enabled in future versions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All user data, such as profile information, progress tracking, and syllabus completion status, are stored locally on your device. Uploaded files, along with your name and email address, are securely transmitted to our Telegram bot for internal review purposes. While we do not intentionally share this information with any third parties, please note that uploads are transmitted via Telegram, and are therefore subject to Telegram’s data policies and storage practices.</p>
    <p>All communications are encrypted in transit using HTTPS or secure Telegram API endpoints.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>All user data stored locally on your device is automatically deleted if you uninstall the app.</p>
    <p>If you have uploaded a file and would like it removed from our system, you may contact us via email. Please provide your name and email used during the upload. We will delete the file promptly if it is still within our review system.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
