    <h2>File Uploads and Shared Data</h2>

      <li>The file itself</li>
      <li>Your name (entered in the app)</li>
      <li>Your email address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used only to review the content before publishing it on the app. We do <strong>not</strong> share this data with any third party except Telegram, which may store it as per their own privacy policy. We recommend avoiding uploading personally sensitive data in any file.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Shared:</strong> Yes, with Telegram (for file submission)</p>
    <p><strong>Data Collected:</strong> Yes, voluntarily provided file and contact info</p>


    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses the following third-party tools and services, which may collect anonymous data for analytics and technical improvements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Firebase Analytics</strong>: Collects anonymized usage data to help improve user experience. No personally identifiable information is included in these analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging</strong>: Used to deliver optional push notifications.</li>
      <li>MPAndroidChart: Used for visualizing data such as mock test performance. Does not collect personal data.</li>
      <li>Retrofit and OkHttp: Used to securely load content from the internet. They do not collect user information by default.</li>
      <li>Telegram Bots: Used to receive user-uploaded educational files. Limited personal info is shared voluntarily as detailed in the next section.</li>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All user data, such as profile information, progress tracking, and syllabus completion status, are stored locally on your device. Uploaded files, along with your name and email address, are securely transmitted to our Telegram bot for internal review purposes. While we do not intentionally share this information with any third parties, please note that uploads are transmitted via Telegram, and are therefore subject to Telegram’s data policies and storage practices.</p>
    <p>All communications are encrypted in transit using HTTPS or secure Telegram API endpoints.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>All user data stored locally on your device is automatically deleted if you uninstall the app.</p>
    <p>If you have uploaded a file and would like it removed from our system, you may contact us via email. Please provide your name and email used during the upload. We will delete the file promptly if it is still within our review system.</p>
    <p>Email: <a href="mailto:learningauorta@gmail.com">learningauorta@gmail.com</a></p>

    <h2>User Control and Opt-Out</h2>
    <p>You can choose not to use the file upload feature if you are uncomfortable sharing information. For Firebase Analytics, if you wish to opt out of anonymized analytics tracking, you can do so in your device settings (by disabling ad personalization or analytics permissions).</p>


    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
