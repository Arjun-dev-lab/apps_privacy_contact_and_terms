        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Teacher's Helper, an app designed to assist teachers in managing their class schedules, reminders, attendance, and accessing educational materials. At Teacher's Helper, your privacy is of utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information. By using this app, you agree to the practices described herein.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect and store the following information to provide the app's core functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name.</li>
            <li>The name of your school (your workplace).</li>
            <li>Details of the class you teach/subject you teach.</li>
            <li>Your class/subject timetable, including periods and timings.</li>
            <li>Attendance details of users (teachers).</li>
            <li>Reminders and notifications based on your timetable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your information is used to enhance your experience and improve the app's functionality. Specifically, we use your data for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Storing and managing your class timetable locally on your device.</li>
            <li>Storing attendance records locally on your device.</li>
            <li>Providing the ability to download attendance details as a file for your records.</li>
            <li>Sending reminders and push notifications for class schedules.</li>
            <li>Improving app performance and user experience using Firebase Analytics.</li>
            <li>Displaying advertisements through Meta Audience Network.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Attendance Details</h2>
        <p>The app includes a feature to manage and download attendance details of the Teacher. By using this feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attendance data is stored locally on your device and is not shared with any third party.</li>
            <li>You can export and download attendance records as a file (PDF) for offline use or record-keeping.</li>
            <li>Responsibility for the accuracy and management of attendance records lies with the user.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        <p>All timetable data, attendance records, and reminders are stored locally on your device. You can delete this data at any time by clearing the app data in your device settings. However, data collected by Firebase Analytics and Meta Audience Network cannot be deleted by users and is subject to their respective privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share your personal data with any third parties, except as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Used for analyzing app performance and user engagement.</li>
            <li><strong>Meta Audience Network:</strong> Used for serving targeted advertisements within the app.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more details, please review the respective privacy policies of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase</a> and <a href="https://www.metaaudience.com/privacy" target="_blank">Meta Audience Network</a>.</p>

        <h2>6. Notifications</h2>
        <p>The app uses both Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and local notifications to deliver reminders and updates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Notifications:</strong> These are used to remind you of your scheduled periods based on the timetable you set within the app. Local notifications are managed directly on your device and do not require an internet connection.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):</strong> This is used to deliver push notifications, including app updates, changes to this Privacy Policy, and other important announcements. These notifications require an internet connection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both types of notifications are integral to the app's functionality and cannot be disabled separately. If you do not wish to receive notifications, you may choose to stop using the app.</p>

        <h2>7. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data, including storing it locally on your device and ensuring secure transmission to Firebase and Meta services. However, no security system is foolproof, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>8. User Rights</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>The right to withdraw from using the app if you disagree with this Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>
